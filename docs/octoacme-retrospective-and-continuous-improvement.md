# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- **Title**: [Brief, action-oriented title]
- **Description**: [Detailed description of what needs to be done]
- **Owner**: [Specific person responsible]
- **Due date**: [Realistic target date]
- **Success criteria**: [Clear, measurable outcome]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Related to**: [Sprint/Release/Incident name]
- **Status**: [Not Started/In Progress/Completed/Blocked]

### Action Item Success Criteria Examples
Good success criteria are specific, measurable, and time-bound:
- ✅ "Reduce average PR review time from 2 days to 1 day by end of Q1"
- ✅ "100% of releases include rollback testing by next sprint"
- ✅ "Document API authentication in README with code examples by Friday"
- ❌ "Improve code review process" (too vague)
- ❌ "Better documentation" (not measurable)
- ❌ "Be faster" (not specific)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Mark items as complete only when success criteria are met
- For blocked items, reassess or adjust success criteria

## Measuring Impact
- Track completion rate of action items (target: >80%)
- Measure metrics before and after implementing improvements
- Survey team satisfaction with changes
- Celebrate wins and share learnings across teams

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Encourage psychological safety - all feedback is valuable
- Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- Make small, iterative changes rather than large overhauls
- Document what you learn and share with other teams
- Recognize and celebrate improvements publicly
